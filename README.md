# PyRun
Python package executor. [Linux only]

#First time Usage
- sudo chmod +x setup.sh
- ./setup.sh

#Usage
- Navigate to dir which has PyRun package ("x.pyrun.zip")
- run "pyrun" for a "cli-based" package executor which allows you to 
choose the package
- run "pyrun x.pyrun.zip" to execute the "x" package

#Creating a PyRun Package
- Create Python code, with multiple modules as files
- Create "pyrun-main.py" (this is the first script which is executed)
- zip all files as "x.pyrun.zip" (where "x" is the name of the PyRun 
package)
